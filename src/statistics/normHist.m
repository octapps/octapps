## compute a pdf-normalized histogram (i.e. the *integral* is 1)
##
## With one vector input argument, plot a histogram of the values with
## 10 bins.  The range of the histogram bins is determined by the
## range of the data.  With one matrix input argument, plot a
## histogram where each bin contains a bar per input column.
##
## Given a second scalar argument, use that as the number of bins.
##
## Given a second vector argument, use that as the centers of the
## bins, with the width of the bins determined from the adjacent
## values in the vector.
