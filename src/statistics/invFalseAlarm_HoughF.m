## 'invert' false-alarm function to obtain discrete numer-count threshold nth which comes
## closest to the desired false-alarm probability fAH0 for Hough-on-Fstat,
## for given number of segments Nseg, and an F-statistic threshold per segment Fth.
## A false-alarm is defined as n >= nth segments crossing the threshold Fth in the
## absence of a signal
##
## returns nth and corresponding actual false-alarm probability fAH
##
## NOTE: all arguments need to be scalars, use arrayfun() or cellfun() to iterate this
## over vectors of arguments
