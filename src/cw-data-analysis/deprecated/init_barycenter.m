function [ephemE, ephemS] = init_barycenter(efile, sfile)

## function [ephemE, ephemS] = init_barycenter(efile, sfile)
##
## This function takes in the filenames of a file containing the Earth
## ephemeris (efile) and Sun ephemeris (sfile) in the format of those within
## LAL e.g. earth00-19-DE405.dat, sun00-19-DE405.dat. It outputs that data in a format
## usuable by the barycentring codes - positions, velocities and
## acceleration:
##   ephem.pos - vector of x, y and z positions (light seconds)
##   ephem.vel - vector of x, y and z velocities (light seconds/second)
##   ephem.acc - vector of x, y and z accelerations (light seconds/second^2)
##
##   ephem.gps - vector of GPS times of the entries
##   ephem.nentries - number of entries in file
##   ephem.dttable - times difference between entries (seconds)
##
## This function is copied from the LAL function LALInitBarycenter.
