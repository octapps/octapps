 ## LVstat = ComputeLineVeto ( twoF_multi, twoF_single, rho, lX, useAllTerms )
 ## function to calculate Line Veto statistics for N detectors
 ## NOTE: input should be 2F, NOT F! Summed, not averaged, over segments!
 ## NOTE2: rho is therefore reinterpreted as "semicoherent rho", including Nseg exponent
 ## NOTE3: return value LVstat therefore still has to be divided  by Nseg to get output comparable to HSGCT
 ## original formula: LVstat = F_multi - log( rho^4/70 + exp(F1)*l1 + exp(F2)*l2 );
 ## implementation here is optimized to avoid underflows ("logsumexp formula")
 ## should be compatible with implementation in lalapps/GCT/LineVeto.c
