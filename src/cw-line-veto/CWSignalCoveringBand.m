 ## [minCoverFreq, maxCoverFreq] = CWSignalCoveringBand  ( fkdot_starttime, fkdotband_starttime, fkdot_endtime, fkdotband_endtime )
 ## based on XLALCWSignalCoveringBand() by K. Wette, R. Prix
 ## Determines a frequency band which covers the frequency evolution of a band of CW signals between two GPS times.
 ## The calculation accounts for the spin evolution of the signals, and the maximum possible Dopper modulation due to detector motion.
 ## binary orbital motion, which is supported by XLALCWSignalCoveringBand(), is dropped here.
 ## contrary to XLALCWSignalCoveringBand, fkdot and fkdotband must be pre-extrapolated to starttime, endtime

 ## Determine the minimum and maximum frequencies covered
 minCoverFreq = min( fkdot_starttime(1), fkdot_endtime(1) );
 maxCoverFreq = max( fkdot_starttime(1) + fkdotband_starttime(1), fkdot_endtime(1) + fkdotband_endtime(1) );

 ## Extra frequency range needed due to detector motion, per unit frequency
 ## Maximum value of the time derivative of the diurnal and (Ptolemaic) orbital phase, plus 5% for luck
