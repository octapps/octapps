## Given the lines lines [x, y1], [x, y2], ..., reduce the number of
## points in each line to 'Nmax'. Points are eliminated based on
## whether they are redundant with other points in each line.
## Usage:
##   [X, [Y1, Y2, ...]] = simplifyLines(x, [y1, y2, ...], Nmax)
## where:
##   x, y1, y2, ... = Input lines
##   Nmax           = Number of points to keep
##   X, Y1, Y2, ... = Output lines
