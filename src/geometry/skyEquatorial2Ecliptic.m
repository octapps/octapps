## Convert a sky-position given in terms of 'longitude' and 'latitude'
## angles into a unit vector vn = [nx, ny, nz] in the same reference frame
## (ie either in equatorial or ecliptic system).
##
## Usage:
##   skyEcl = skyEquatorial2Ecliptic ( skyEq )
##
## convert input sky-position in equatorial reference frame into ecliptic frame
##
## Input 3-vectors are interpreted as sky-vectors vn = [nx, ny, nz] (un-normalized),
## while 2-vectors are interpreted as sky angles [longitude, latitude],
## and the output uses the same format as the input (ie vector --> vector, angles-->angles).
## Multiple values can be input as column-vectors, ie Nx3 for vectors vn, Nx2 for angles
## [simple wrapper for skyRotateFrame()]

function skyEcl = skyEquatorial2Ecliptic ( skyEqu )

  UnitsConstants;
  skyEcl = skyRotateFrame ( skyEqu, -IEARTH, [ 1; 0; 0] );	## rotation equatorial->ecliptic
  return;
