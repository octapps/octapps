## Convert a sky-position given in terms of 'longitude' and 'latitude'
## angles into a unit vector vn = [nx, ny, nz] in the same reference frame
## (ie either in equatorial or ecliptic system).
##
## Usage:
##   skyOut = skyRotateFrame ( skyIn, angle, axis )
##
## convert input sky-position by rotating the reference by 'angle' around 3-vector 'axis'
##
## Input 3-vectors are interpreted as sky-vectors vn = [nx, ny, nz] (un-normalized),
## while 2-vectors are interpreted as sky angles [longitude, latitude],
## and the output uses the same format as the input (ie vector --> vector, angles-->angles).
## Multiple values can be input as column-vectors, ie Nx3 for vectors vn, Nx2 for angles

function skyOut = skyRotateFrame ( skyIn, angle, axis )

  ## check input
  [ r, c ] = size ( skyIn );
  assert ( (c == 2) || (c == 3), "Invalid input vector 'skyIn' must be either Nx2 (for sky-angles) or Nx3 (for sky-vectors), got %d x %d\n", r, c );

  haveAngles = ( c == 2 );
  ## if angles input, convert them to vectors first
  if ( haveAngles )
    vnIn = skyAngles2Vector ( skyIn );
  else
    vnIn = skyIn;
  endif
  rotM = rotationMatrix ( angle, axis );        ## rotation matrix in-->out
  vnOut = rotM * vnIn';
  vnOut = vnOut';       ## return in N x 3 format

  ## return in same 'coordinates' as input: sky-vector or sky-angles
  if ( haveAngles )
    skyOut = skyVector2Angles ( vnOut );
  else
    skyOut = vnOut;
  endif

  return;
